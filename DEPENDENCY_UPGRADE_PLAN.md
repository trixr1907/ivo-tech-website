# Dependency Upgrade Plan

## Current Issues

### 1. React & React DOM
- Current: 18.2.0
- Latest: 19.1.0
- Impact: Major version upgrade, requires careful testing
- Dependencies affected: @testing-library/react, @types/react-dom

### 2. Three.js Ecosystem
- @react-three/drei: 9.122.0 → 10.5.2
- @react-three/fiber: 8.18.0 → 9.2.0
- three: 0.162.0 → 0.178.0
- @types/three: 0.162.0 → 0.178.1

## Upgrade Strategy

### Phase 1: Three.js Ecosystem
1. Upgrade three.js and its types:
   ```bash
   pnpm up -r three@0.178.0 @types/three@0.178.1
   ```

2. Upgrade React Three Fiber ecosystem:
   ```bash
   pnpm up -r @react-three/drei@10.5.2 @react-three/fiber@9.2.0
   ```

3. Test 3D components:
   - Check AnimatedLogo4D
   - Verify EpicScene3D
   - Test all shader effects
   - Verify performance metrics

### Phase 2: React 19 Migration
1. Review breaking changes in React 19
2. Update testing libraries first:
   ```bash
   pnpm up -r @testing-library/react @testing-library/react-hooks
   ```

3. Update React core:
   ```bash
   pnpm up -r react@19.1.0 react-dom@19.1.0
   ```

4. Update React types:
   ```bash
   pnpm up -r @types/react @types/react-dom
   ```

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Run existing test suite
- Add tests for new React 19 features
- Verify 3D component rendering

### Integration Tests
- Test full application flow
- Verify SSR functionality
- Check build output

### Performance Tests
- Measure bundle sizes
- Check runtime performance
- Monitor memory usage

## Rollback Plan

1. Keep old dependency versions documented
2. Maintain backup of package.json
3. Document all changes in git commits
4. Create restore points before major upgrades

## Timeline

1. Three.js Ecosystem: 1-2 days
   - Upgrade: 2 hours
   - Testing: 4-6 hours
   - Fixes: 4-8 hours

2. React 19 Migration: 2-3 days
   - Preparation: 4 hours
   - Migration: 4-6 hours
   - Testing: 8-12 hours
   - Fixes: 8-12 hours

Total estimated time: 3-5 days

## Success Criteria

1. All tests passing
2. No performance regressions
3. Build size within acceptable limits
4. No runtime errors in production
5. All 3D features functioning correctly
